# 🧠 My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my personal learning journey into **Machine Learning** as a 3rd-year Computer Science undergraduate. I'm learning by building hands-on projects, exploring algorithms, and studying core ML concepts using Python.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Build a solid foundation in Machine Learning
- Complete multiple mini-projects based on real and simulated datasets
- Document my learning progress publicly
- Apply ML skills in real-world domains like scientific computing and classification problems
- Grow into internship and collaboration opportunities

---

## 📚 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📅 Weekly Progress

| Week | Topic / Project | Description | Link |
|------|------------------|-------------|------|
| 1 | **Intro to ML & Linear Regression** | Basic regression with real-world housing data |
| 2 | **Gamma Particle Detection (MC Simulation)** | Classification using Random Forest on telescope simulation data. |
| 3 | **Iris Dataset: Sepal Length Prediction using Decision Tree Regression**| Predicting iris sepal length using a Decision Tree Regressor based on other features of the iris flower. |

## 📂 Projects

# 🔹 [Gamma Particle Classifier](link)
- Simulated data from an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (MC generated)
- Random Forest model to classify gamma vs hadron events
- Learned feature engineering, model training, and evaluation

# 🔹 [Linear Regression Playground](link)
- First hands-on with regression
- Used scikit-learn to predict target values from basic features
- Practiced train-test split and performance metrics

# 🔹 [Sapel Length Prediction](link)
- This project utilizes a Decision Tree Regressor on the Iris dataset to predict sepal length.
- It walks through data loading, feature definition, model training, prediction, and validation using Mean Absolute Error.
- The provided notebook guides users through these steps to understand the regression process.
